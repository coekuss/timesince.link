# timesince.link

timesince.link is a lightweight web tool (14KB total) for measuring the time since a certain event on a certain date. The link contains all the info about your event so you can bookmark it, send it to people, or whatever else.

## Privacy Policy:

It's hosted on static web hosting so no data is sent back to a server. *The only place your data is stored is inside the link you generate.* The javascript on the landing page simply reads your link and calculates the time. Very clean if you ask me
